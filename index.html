        <p>Welcome to my portfolio.  This showcases some projects for school, internships and more.  Some things are still a work in progress,
        I am not a master.. yet.  I have had a lot of fun with this, the animations, learning to use different containers.  One of the things
        that I am happy to have started learning was Mobile First Design and creating some of the pages to be responsive to different
        window sizes.</p>
        <p>The Travel Blog was made from scratch.  I am really proud of the work that was done with my colleague Edmund.  We started with a design, made mockeups, performed UI testing,
            used html, java and css to code the website and it was a lot of fun.  It was moved from an FTP server to github but the link to github will work.
            I will add more stuff as I continue gaining knowledge in the programming field and pursue a Bachelors degree in 
        Mobile Application Development.  You can also check me out on LinkedIn,  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamdkohler">Adam Kohler</a></p>
